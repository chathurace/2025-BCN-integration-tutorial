## Example 1: Generate OpenAPI Specs and service code

1. Let's start by creating a new integration in Ballerina Integrator. 
    ![Create new integration](./images/Create-new-integration.png)

    ![Add integraiton name](./images/Add-integration-name.png)

- Integration name : `TechStore`
- Integration Path : Select a local path

5. Let's use `/openapi` with follwoing prompt to generate OpenAPI spec for order service.

    ```
    Generate OpenAPI spec for computer hardware store to manage order
    ```

6. It generated the spec and you can add it to the integration project after reviewing.

7. Now let's generate the source code for this service using the generated spec. You can use `/generate` with a prompt like below. Then you can add the generated code to the integration project. 

    ```
    Generate code for the above spec.
    ```

8. Add the generated code to the integration project.

9. Now, you can explore and edit the generated service if needed.

10. Finally, let's generate tests for the service using `/tests` with the following prompt.You can use `@` within the prompt to list down available service names within your project. 

    ```
    /tests generate test using /v1 service 
    ```
    ![alt text](./images/Generate-tests.png)

11. First it will create the test plan and then the tests which we can add to the project.
